# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer is a react based web application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms (currently breadth-first search and depth-first search). The user can create walls and see how the algorithms find the shortest path.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DaniAbdulm/pathfinding-visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd pathfinding-visualizer
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Create walls by clicking on the grid.
3. Set the start and end points.
4. Choose a pathfinding algorithm (BFS, DFS, A*).
5. Click on the "Start" button to visualize the algorithm.
6. Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.

## Features

- Interactive grid for creating walls and setting start/end points.
- Visualization of different pathfinding algorithms.
- Adjustable speed for visualization.
- Reset functionality to clear the grid.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **A* (A-star) Algorithm**
